To build for debug on windows VS, add `_ALLOW_RTCc_IN_STL;` to each project's "Preprocessor Definitions"

Drop the other steering models (pprAI, sfAI, simpleAI). The virtual base class has been extended and these inherited classes have not implemented all the functionality (e.g. is_bag)

To get navmesh working include the navmesh module, e.g.
```
<startupModules>
    <module>navmesh</module>
</startupModules>
```
